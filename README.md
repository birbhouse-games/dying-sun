## A message from The Council

> Haven stands as the last bastion for survival under our dying sun, and it must be protected at all costs. Your skill with a blade places you among the few capable of surviving the wasteland, so we must ask: will you protect us?
>
> Your objective: Recover vital resources from the wasteland. Salvage what you can. You'll likely encounter others seeking these precious resources - raiders equipped with crude weapons and advanced machines of war. Make no mistake: there is not enough to share, and we will not yield what we need to survive to those who invaded our planet.
>
> Remember your training. Use the power stations scattered through the wasteland to recharge when needed. And most importantly - return to Haven with the supplies our people desperately need.
>
> The crimson sky grows darker with each passing day. Time is not on our side.
>
> Deploy with honor,
> The Council

## The Game

_Dying Sun_ is a cooperative multiplayer game where you'll explore a barren world, scavenging for resources to keep your home — Haven — from collapse. You'll encounter all manner of enemies across the wasteland looking for the same resources. Defeat them and take their loot to improve Haven, giving you access to new upgrades to survive the world outside the walls.
